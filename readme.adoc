= asciidoc

Grammar, parser, printer for https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[asciidoc].

WARNING: The grammar does not follow asciidoc perfectly, but gets you 99% there.

== ToDo

* Improve AST types for well-known attributes. Many position attributes correlate to concrete things, but aren't modeled. For example `[quote, Albert Einstein]` are just two generic `Attribute`s, but the second could be a `AttributeAuthor` or similar.

== Known Issues

* List levels. No fancy list marker switching yields nesting behavior changes.
* Escaped list marker: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/ordered/#escaping-the-list-marker
* block masquerading https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/masquerading/
* Non-default fence lengths (e.g. 5 char `=====` fences for an BlockExample)
